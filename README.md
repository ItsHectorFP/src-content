# Wizkid Terminal Source Projects

Source projects for various programs. You are welcome to use them as long you follow the licenses presented per file or project. Make a spin of one of my projects!

## What are spins?

Inspired by the Fedora Project, "spins" are derivatives of my original projects. You can spin one of my projects to add, update, or remove features in the projects. To do this, you download the original project files. That's it! Now you can do your thing! [Click here](https://github.com/Mr-Terminal/mrt-src-projects/wiki#spins) for more information about spins.
