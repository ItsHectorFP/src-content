# Wizkid Terminal Source Projects

Source projects for various programs. You are welcome to use them as long you follow the licenses presented per file or project. Make a spin of one of my projects!

## What are spins?

Inspired by the Fedora Project, "spins" are derivatives of my original projects. You can spin one of my projects to add, update, or remove features in the projects. To do this, you download the original project files. That's it! Now you can do your thing!

## Publishing a spin

Spins are a fun way to create derivatives of my original projects. You can post your spins to any platform as you please. But to ensure it is officially called a spin by definition, you need to follow the instructions below.

Start by adding credits to the description of your page. Follow this template:

`Original work by [author(s)]. Spin by [user who spin-off the original work.]`

For example:

`Original work by Wizkid Terminal. Spin by SFMguy782`.

Next, if possible, add a link that leads into the GitHub repo of the source project:

`[post link here]`

Credit is necessary to ensure the original authors' work does not go unnoticed. I won't be too strict about it, but keep in mind that you didn't make the project entirely, so make sure to credit the original author(s).
